# TODO for DOM Challenge Implementation

- [x] Comment out the script tag for js/index.min.js in index.html to disable original functionality.
- [x] Implement auto-incrementing counter every second using setInterval in js/challenge.js.
- [x] Add event listener for plus button to increment counter.
- [x] Add event listener for minus button to decrement counter.
- [x] Add event listener for heart button to increment likes for current counter value and render in likes list.
- [x] Add event listener for pause button to toggle pause/resume, disable/enable buttons, and update button text.
- [x] Add event listener for comment form submit to add new comment paragraph to comments div.
- [x] Test the application by opening index.html in browser, verifying auto-increment, button interactions, likes display, pause/resume, and comment submission. (Note: Browser testing failed due to system libraries; please test manually.)
